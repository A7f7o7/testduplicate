No religious test shall be required, as a qualification for office, nor shall any person be incompetent to be a witness on account of his religious belief; but nothing herein shall be construed to dispense with oaths and affirmations. Religion, morality, and knowledge, however, being essential to good government, it shall be the duty of the general assembly to pass suitable laws to protect every religious denomination in the peaceable enjoyment of its own mode of public worship, and to encourage schools and the means of instruction.',

Where a person is charged with any offense for which the person may be incarcerated, the court may determineat any time the type, amount, and conditions of bail. Excessive bail shall not be required; nor excessive fines imposed; nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. \n\nThe General Assembly shall fix by law standards to determine whether a person who is charged with a felony where the proof is evident or the presumptiongreat poses a substantial risk of serious physical harm to any person or to the community.

In any trial, in any court, the party accused shall be allowed to appear and defend in person and with counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and to have a copy thereof; to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to procure the attendance of witnesses in his behalf, and a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed; but provision may be made by law for the taking of the deposition by the accused or by the state, to be used for or against the accused, of any witness whose attendance can not be had at the trial, always securing to the accused means and the opportunity to be present in person and with counsel at the taking of such deposition, and to examine the witness face to face as fully and in the same manner as if in court. No person shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself; but his failure to testify may be considered by the court and jury and may be made the subject of comment by counsel.

The full faith and credit of the state of Ohio is hereby pledged for the payment of such bonds. All bonds so issued shall mature in thirty semi-annual installments after the respective dates thereof, and the maturities thereof shall be so fixed that the total amounts of payments on account of principal and interest to be paid on each of such semi-annual installment payment dates shall be approximately equal, but no such bonds shall be issued or bear dates later than the first day of April, 1951. All bonds so issued shall bear interest at such rates as the commissioners of the sinking fund may fix, which interest shall be payable semi-annually. Such bonds, and the interest thereon as income, shall be exempt from all taxes levied by the state of Ohio or any taxing district thereof. The bonds may, at the option of the sinking fund commission, be issued subject to call on any interest payment date at par and accrued interest. All sales of such bonds by the commissioners of the sinking fund shall be in accordance with such regulations as it shall make and promulgate, provided, however, that such bonds shall be sold only to the highest bidder or bidders therefor after notice of such sale shall have been published once each week for three consecutive weeks on the same day of each of such weeks, the first of such notices being published at least twenty-one full days before the date of sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in each of the eight most populous counties in the state of Ohio, and provided that each of such published notices shall state the day, hour and place of the sale, the total face value of the bonds to be sold, their denominations, dates, and the dates of their maturities, information relative to the rates of interest which the bonds will bear, and the dates upon which interest will be payable. The commissioners of the sinking fund shall have the right to reject any or all bids and to re-advertise and re-offer bonds for sale. Out of the proceeds of the sale of all bonds that amount which represents accrued interest, if any, shall be paid into the treasury of the state of Ohio into a fund to be known as the World War II compensation bond retirement fund. The balance shall be paid into the treasury of the state of Ohio into a fund to be known as the World War II compensation fund. The general assembly of the state of Ohio may appropriate and cause to be paid into the World War II compensation bond retirement fund or the World War II compensation fund, out of the funds in the treasury of the state not otherwise appropriated, such amounts as it may deem proper for use upon order of the commissioners of the sinking fund for the purposes for which such funds are created as herein provided. If the general assembly should so appropriate any funds to the World War II compensation fund prior to the time the commissioners of the sinking fund shall have issued bonds of the aggregate total amount of face value authorized in this section, the aggregate total amount of face value of bonds so authorized to be issued shall be reduced by the amount of the funds so appropriated.

To secure such monthly transfer of funds a lien is hereby created upon all funds coming into the state treasury after January 1, 1949, derived from taxes as aforesaid, which lien shall be the first and best lien upon all such funds. It shall be the duty of the treasurer of state to set aside and use for the purpose of making such monthly transfer of funds, part of each dollar received in the state treasury in each calendar year during said period of fifteen years beginning January 1, 1949, derived from taxes as aforesaid, so that the total amount of money so set aside in each of such calendar years shall be twelve million dollars, and so that the ratio which the amount of each dollar so set aside shall bear to one dollar shall be the same as the ratio which the amount of twelve million dollars shall bear to the total amount of money received in the state treasury in such calendar years derived from taxes as aforesaid. The treasurer of state shall set aside part of each such dollar before paying out, transferring, or disposing of in any other manner, such dollar or any part thereof for any other purpose whatsoever, and he shall make the transfer of one million dollars each month to the World War II compensation bond retirement fund, hereinabove provided for, out of said sum of twelve million dollars so set aside in each of such calendar years.

Such levy shall be in addition to all other taxes levied now or hereafter within the period during which bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be outstanding, by or pursuant to law or any provision of the Constitution of the state of Ohio, and shall not be considered in applying any limitation or aggregate tax rates now or hereafter within the period during which bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be outstanding, provided by or pursuant to law or any provision of the Constitution of the state of Ohio.

It is hereby determined that such capital improvements will directly or indirectly create jobs, enhance employment opportunities, and improve the economic welfare of the people of the state.
    
    The issuance under authority of this section of obligations the holders or owners of which are given the right to have excises and taxes levied by the general assembly for the payment of the principal thereof or interest thereon, herein called tax supported obligations, shall be subject to the following limitations. Not more than one hundred million dollars principal amount may be issued in any calendar year and not more than five hundred million dollars principal amount may be outstanding at any one time for such capital improvements for highways and research and development with respect to highways and highway transportation, herein called highway obligations, provided that fifty per cent of the proceeds of the first five hundred million dollars of such tax supported highway obligations shall be used for urban extensions of state highways and highways within or leading to municipal corporations. Not more than two hundred fifty nine million dollars aggregate principal amount of such tax supported obligations may be issued for the other capital improvements aforesaid, provided that from the proceeds thereof one hundred twenty million dollars shall be used for water pollution control and abatement and water management, one hundred million dollars shall be used for higher education, technical and vocational education, and juvenile correction, training and rehabilitation, twenty million dollars shall be used for parks and recreation, and nineteen million dollars for airports, and for construction, rehabilitation and equipping of other state buildings and structures, including those for police and fire training. If tax supported obligations are issued under authority of this section to retire tax supported obligations previously issued under authority of this section, such new obligations shall not be counted against such limits to the extent that the principal amount thereof does not exceed the principal amount of the obligations to be retired thereby.

    Each issue of tax supported obligations issued pursuant to this section shall mature in not more than thirty years from the date of issuance thereof, or, if issued to retire obligations issued hereunder, within thirty years from the date such debt was originally contracted. If such tax supported obligations are issued as notes in anticipation of the issuance of bonds, provision shall be made by law for setting aside, so long as such notes are outstanding, into a special fund or funds such amounts from the sources authorized for payment of such bonds under this section as would be sufficient for payment of that amount of principal on such bonds that would have been payable during such period if such bonds, maturing during a period of thirty years, had been issued without prior issuance of such notes. Such fund or funds may be used solely for the payment of principal of such notes or of bonds in anticipation of which such notes have been issued.

    The faith and credit and excises and taxes of the state, excluding ad valorem taxes on real or personal property and income taxes, shall be pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on such tax supported obligations, sinking or bond retirement fund provisions shall be made therefor, and this section shall otherwise be implemented, all in the manner and to the extent provided by law by the general assembly, including provisions for appropriation of pledged excises and taxes, and covenants to continue their levy, collection and application, to continue so long as such tax supported obligations are outstanding, without necessity for further appropriation notwithstanding Section 22 of Article II, Ohio Constitution; provided that the moneys referred to in Section 5a of Article XII, Ohio Constitution, herein called highway user receipts, shall, after provision for payment of amounts pledged to obligations heretofore or hereafter issued under Sections 2c and 2g of this Article, be pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on highway obligations authorized by this section but not to other obligations authorized hereby. If excises and taxes other than highway user receipts are pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on highway obligations authorized by this section, in each year that such highway user receipts are available for such purpose, the same shall be appropriated thereto and the required application of such other excises and taxes shall be reduced in corresponding amount.

    The general assembly also may authorize the issuance of revenue obligations and other obligations, the owners or holders of which are not given the right to have excises or taxes levied by the general assembly for the payment of principal thereof or interest thereon, for such capital improvements for mental hygiene and retardation, parks and recreation, state supported and state assisted institutions of higher education, including those for technical education, water pollution control and abatement, water management, and housing of branches and agencies of state government, which obligations shall not be subject to other provisions of this section and shall not be deemed to be debts or bonded indebtedness of the state under other provisions of this Constitution. Such obligations may be secured by a pledge under law, without necessity for further appropriation, of all or such portion as the general assembly authorizes of charges for the treatment or care of mental hygiene and retardation patients, receipts with respect to parks and recreational facilities, receipts of or on behalf of state supported and state assisted institutions of higher education, or other revenues or receipts, specified by law for such purpose, of the state or its officers, departments, divisions, institutions, boards, commissions, authorities, or other state agencies or instrumentalities, and this provision may be implemented by law to better provide therefor; provided, however, that any charges for the treatment or care of mental hygiene or retardation patients may be so pledged only to obligations issued for capital improvements for mental hygiene and retardation, any receipts with respect to parks and recreation may be so pledged only to obligations issued for capital improvements for parks and recreation, any receipts of or on behalf of state supported or state assisted institutions of higher education may be pledged only to obligations issued for capital improvements for state supported or state assisted institutions of higher education, and any other revenues or receipts may be so pledged only to obligations issued for capital improvements which are in whole or in part useful to, constructed by, or financed by the department, board, commission, authority, or other agency or instrumentality that receives the revenues or receipts so pledged.

The aggregate face value of bonds or notes so issued shall not exceed three hundred million dollars. The full faith and credit of the state is hereby pledged for the payment of such bonds or notes.
    
    All bonds or notes so issued shall mature in not more than fifteen years commencing not later than two years after the respective dates thereof. The bonds or notes shall mature according to schedules set forth by the commissioners but shall not mature more than fifteen years after the date of issue. No bonds or notes shall be issued or bear dates later than the first day of April, 1977.
    
    All bonds or notes shall bear interest at such rates as the commissioners determine and shall be payable semiannually. Such bonds or notes, and the interest thereon are exempt from all taxes levied by the state or any taxing district thereof. At the option of the commissioners, the bonds or notes may be issued subject to call on any interest payment date at par and accrued interest.

    All sales of such bonds or notes by the commissioners shall be in accordance with such regulations as the commission adopts and promulgates. Such bonds or notes shall be sold only to the highest bidder or bidders after notice of sale has been published once each week for three consecutive weeks on the same day of each week, the first of such notices being published at least twenty-one full days before the date of sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in each of the eight most populous counties in the state. Notices shall state the day, hour and place of the sale, the total face value of the bonds or notes to be sold, their denominations, dates, and the dates of their maturities, information relative to the rates of interest that the bonds or notes will bear, and the dates upon which interest will be payable. The commissioners may reject any or all bids and readvertise and re-offer bonds or notes for sale.

The General Assembly may appropriate and cause to be paid into the Vietnam Conflict Compensation Bond Retirement Fund or the Vietnam Conflict Compensation Fund, out of the funds in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amount as is proper for use, upon order of the commissioners for the purposes for which such funds are created. If the General Assembly appropriates any funds to the Vietnam Conflict Compensation Fund prior to the time the commissioners have issued bonds or notes of the aggregate amount of face value authorized in this section, the aggregate amount of face value of bonds or notes so authorized to be issued shall be reduced by the amount of the funds so appropriated.

    On or before the first day of July in each calendar year, the commissioners shall certify to the auditor of state the total amount of funds it determines is necessary to provide, together with all other money that will be available in the Vietnam Conflict Compensation Bond Retirement Fund, for the retirement of bonds or notes and the payment of interest in the ensuing calendar year.

The Vietnam Conflict Compensation Bond Retirement Fund shall be paid out without appropriation by the General Assembly, upon the order of the commissioners for the purpose of the payment, or retirement in other manner, of said bonds or notes and interest thereon.

The maximum amount of cash payable to any qualified applicant, unless such applicant qualifies for a payment based upon missing in action or prisoner of war status or unless such applicant qualifies for a survivor's payment, is five hundred dollars. No compensation shall be paid under this section to any person who received from another state a bonus or compensation of a like nature or to any person who has not served on active duty in the armed forces of the United States during the compensable period for at least ninety days unless active duty within such compensable period was terminated as a result of injuries or illness sustained in Vietnam service. Compensation for a fraction of a month of service shall be paid on the basis of one-thirtieth of the appropriate monthly amounts for each day of such service.

    Each obligation so issued shall mature not later than the thirty-first day of December of the fifteenth calendar year after its issuance, except that obligations issued to refund obligations under this section shall mature not later than the thirty-first day of December of the fifteenth calendar year after the year in which the original obligation was issued. Except for obligations issued under this section to retire or refund obligations previously issued under this section, no obligations shall be issued under this section later than December 31, 2013.

    In the case of the issuance of any obligations under this section as bond anticipation notes, provision shall be made in the bond or note proceedings for the establishment, and the maintenance during the period the notes are outstanding, of special funds into which there shall be paid, from the sources authorized for payment of the bonds anticipated, the amount that would have been sufficient to pay the principal that would have been payable on those bonds during that period if bonds maturing serially in each year over the maximum period of maturity referred to in this section had been issued without the prior issuance of the notes. Those special funds and investment income on them shall be used solely for the payment of debt service on those notes or the bonds anticipated.

    The obligations issued under this section, their transfer, and the interest, interest equivalent, and other income thereon, including any profit made on their sale, exchange, or other disposition, shall at all times be free from taxation within the state.

    Such obligations may be sold at public or private sale as determined by the Ohio public facilities commission.

    (B) Out of the proceeds of the sale of all obligations, except those issued to refund or retire obligations previously issued under this section, the amount that represents accrued interest, if any, shall be paid into the state treasury into the Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation bond retirement fund, which is hereby created. As determined at the time of sale, the amount that represents premium shall be paid into either the Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation bond retirement fund or the Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation fund, which is hereby created in the state treasury. The balance of the proceeds shall be paid into the Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation fund. All proceeds of the sale of any obligations issued under this section to refund or retire obligations previously issued under this section shall be paid into the Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation bond retirement fund and used to pay debt service on those outstanding obligations so refunded. The general assembly may appropriate and cause to be paid into the Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation bond retirement fund or the Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation fund, out of money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amount as is proper for use for the purposes for which such funds are created. Except for amounts advanced by the general assembly to the Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation fund with the express expectation of reimbursement from the proceeds of obligations paid into that fund, and except for amounts transferred under division (E) of this section for the purpose of defraying the immediate cost of administration and compensation, if the general assembly appropriates any funds to the Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation fund prior to the time obligations have been issued in the original principal amount authorized in this section, that original principal amount authorized in this section shall be reduced by the amount of funds appropriated.

    (C) On or before the fifteenth day of July of each fiscal year, the Ohio public facilities commission shall certify, or cause to be certified, to the director of budget and management the total amount of money required during the current fiscal year, together with all other money that will be available in the Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation bond retirement fund, to meet in full all debt service and related financing costs on the obligations issued under this section. The director shall transfer from the general revenue fund to the Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation bond retirement fund, without necessity of appropriation by the general assembly, an amount equal to the amount so certified, and those funds shall be used for the payment of the debt service.

    (D)(1) The Persian gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts compensation fund shall be paid out upon the order of the department of veterans services, without necessity of appropriation by the general assembly, in payment of the expenses of administering this section and as compensation as follows to each person who meets all of the following requirements:

If the United States department of veterans' affairs determines that the person's death was the result of injuries or illness sustained in Persian gulf, Afghanistan, or Iraq service, the person's survivors are entitled to, and may apply for, a survivor's payment of five thousand dollars, regardless of the amount of compensation that the deceased would have been entitled to receive under this section, if living. The survivor's payment shall be made to the surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse, the payment shall go to the surviving child or children.

      '''(A) In addition to the authorizations otherwise contained in Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution, the General Assembly may provide by law, in accordance with and subject to the limitations of this section, for the issuance of bonds and other obligations of the state for the purpose of financing or assisting in the financing of the cost of public infrastructure capital improvements of municipal corporations, counties, townships, and other governmental entities as designated by law. As used in this section, public infrastructure capital improvements shall be limited to roads and bridges, waste water treatment systems, water supply systems, solid waste disposal facilities, and storm water and sanitary collection, storage, and treatment facilities, including real property, interests in real property, facilities, and equipment related to or incidental thereto, and shall include, without limitation, the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, expansion, improvement, planning, and equipping.

    (B) Not more than one billion eight hundred seventy-five million dollars principal amount of state general obligations may be issued under this section for public infrastructure capital improvements.

    (C) Each issue of obligations issued under this section shall mature in not more than thirty years from the date of issuance, or, if issued to retire or refund other obligations, within that number of years from the date the debt being retired or refunded was originally issued. If state general obligations are issued as notes in anticipation of the issuance of bonds, provision shall be made by law for the establishment and maintenance, during the period in which the notes are outstanding, of a special fund or funds into which shall be paid, from the sources authorized for the payment of such bonds, the amount that would have been sufficient, if bonds maturing during the permitted period of years had been issued without such prior issuance of notes, to pay the principal that would have been payable on such bonds during such period. Such fund or funds shall be used solely for the payment of principal of such notes or bonds in anticipation of which such notes have been issued. Obligations issued under this section to retire or refund obligations previously issued under this section or Section 2k, 2m, or 2p shall not be counted against the fiscal year or total issuance limitations provided in this section or Section 2k, 2m, or 2p, as applicable.

The full faith and credit, revenue, and taxing power of the state shall be pledged to the payment of the principal of and premium and interest and other accreted amounts on outstanding obligations as they become due (hereinafter called debt service), and bond retirement fund provisions shall be made for payment of that debt service. Provision shall be made by law for the sufficiency and appropriation, for purposes of paying debt service, of excises, taxes, and revenues so pledged or committed to debt service, and for covenants to continue the levy, collection, and application of sufficient excises, taxes, and revenues to the extent needed for that purpose. Notwithstanding Section 22 of Article II, Ohio Constitution, no further act of appropriation shall be necessary for that purpose. The obligations and the provision for the payment of debt service, and repayment by governmental entities of any loans made under this section, are not subject to Sections 5, 6, and 11 of Article XII, Ohio Constitution. Moneys referred to in Section 5a of Article XII, Ohio Constitution may not be pledged to the payment of that debt service.

    (E) The state may participate in any public infrastructure capital improvement under this section with municipal corporations, counties, townships, or other governmental entities as designated by law, or any one or more of them. Such participation may be by grants, loans, or contributions to them for any such capital improvements. The entire proceeds of the infrastructure obligations shall be used for public infrastructure capital improvements of municipal corporations, counties, townships, and other governmental entities, except to the extent that the General Assembly provides by law that the state may reasonably be compensated from such moneys for planning, financial management, or administrative services performed in relation to the issuance of infrastructure obligations.

    (F) Obligations issued under authority of this section, the transfer thereof, and the interest, interest equivalent, and other income and accreted amounts there from, including any profit made on the sale, exchange, or other disposition thereof, shall at all times be free from taxation within the state.

    (G) This section shall otherwise be implemented in the manner and to the extent provided by law by the General Assembly, including provision for the procedure for incurring and issuing obligations, separately or in combination with other obligations, and refunding, retiring, and evidencing obligations, and provision for the use to the extent practicable of Ohio products, materials, services, and labor in the making of any project financed, in whole or in part, under this section.

    (H) The powers and authority granted or confirmed by and under, and the determinations in, this section are independent of, in addition to, and not in derogation of or a limitation on, powers, authority, determinations, or confirmations under laws or under other provisions of the Ohio Constitution and do not impair any previously adopted provisions of the Ohio Constitution or any law previously enacted by the General Assembly or by a local public agency.
